“With a small program of a few hundred lines, you can get away without much organization, but as programs scale, they quickly become impossible to manage alone…
Much of this challenge occurs because requirements change, and every time they do, code has to change to accommodate. The more code there is and the more entangled it is, the harder it is to change and more likely you are to break things.
This is where architecture comes in.”

• Todo sistema complejo se compone de subsistemas que interactúan.
• Un enfoque para diseñar sistemas es identificar subsistemas y la forma que interactúan entre ellos.
• La arquitectura de software tiene ese objetivo.
• Es un área que recibe mucha atención.

“The idea of software architecture has at its foundation a principle of information hiding: the less a part of a program knows about other parts of a program, the easier it is to change. The most popular information hiding strategy is encapsulation: this is the idea of designing self-contained abstractions with well-defined interfaces that separate different concerns in a program. Programming languages offer encapsulation support through things like functions and classes, which encapsulate data and functionality together. Another programming language encapsulation method is scoping, which hides variables and other names from other parts of program outside a scope.”
